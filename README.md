### Game developer learning path

First project following the course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFe77GJs4EQ&list=PLNEAWvYbJJ9ltV9VYRjrX0_E098SZny7k

_Resume_: The game is about a big ball that should consume smoller balls in the plane and once it is done continue to a new level. There are three levels, level 2 and 3 is about the same but they have a new entity called "enemy", if the enemy will follow the big ball movement and if it touch the big ball then the level will be restarted.
